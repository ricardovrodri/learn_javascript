## In this directory, we will be working on understanding and building all my work for the subject SOS at the University of Seville, it may include work in javascript and NodeJS.

So far we have had three main learning experiences in classes in the laboratory.

# Clase 01

It's all about an introduction to Javascript throw a series of examples and code. We learn about functions, history and iteration.

# Clase 02

This time we learn all about packages, modules, importation and some important modules such as express for making an easy server. At last, we learn about promises as well.
